# coding-quiz-for-you

## Description

This is a quiz created with 4 questions about programming.
It will tell you if your question is correct or wrong.
It had a 30 second timer that counts down to zero.
If you get a question wrong it will deduct 7 seconds each time until it gets to zero.
When the questions have been answered you will be prompted to enter the initials of your name.
Once you click the submit button it will take you to the highscores page where you will see your score plus any other scores from other who have played.
If you click the clear highscores button it will clear local storage, which will clear all of the scores.

## Usage

- This is only to be used by me for studying purposes.
